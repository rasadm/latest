# 🚀 How to Run the AI Content Management System

## ✅ The System is Working!

Your AI-powered multilingual content management system is fully functional and organized. Here are the ways to run it:

## 🎯 Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Main Project Dashboard (Recommended)
```bash
start_app.bat
```
**OR**
```bash
.\start_app.bat
```

### Option 2: Interactive Menu
```bash
quick_start.bat
```
**OR**
```bash
.\quick_start.bat
```

### Option 3: Individual Dashboards

#### Project Management Dashboard
```bash
start_app.bat
```

#### Content Creation Dashboard
```bash
start_content_dashboard.bat
```

#### Settings Dashboard
```bash
start_settings_dashboard.bat
```

## 🔧 Manual Commands (if needed)

If the batch files don't work, you can run manually with proper Python path:

```powershell
# Set Python path and run main dashboard
$env:PYTHONPATH="L:\blogs1\blogs1"; python dashboards/project_dashboard.py

# Set Python path and run content dashboard
$env:PYTHONPATH="L:\blogs1\blogs1"; python dashboards/content_dashboard.py

# Set Python path and run settings dashboard
$env:PYTHONPATH="L:\blogs1\blogs1"; python dashboards/settings_dashboard.py
```

## 📁 What Each Dashboard Does

## 🎉 Everything is Working!

The system organization was successful and **all functionality is preserved**:

- ✅ All original features work exactly as before

## 🚨 If You Get Import Errors

If you see "ModuleNotFoundError", make sure you're using the provided batch files (`.bat`) which automatically set the correct Python path.

**Don't run** `python dashboards/project_dashboard.py` directly - use `start_app.bat` instead!
